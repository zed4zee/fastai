    "text": "In order to be a great deep learning practitioner, it was adviced by Jeremy and putforward by Radek to master this idea of the “4-legged” table.\nI need to work on these things in a structured way. I have been Googling stuff around to find various things. Apart from doing the PDLC course, I will be spending some time daily working on these things. My coding skills aren’t sharp as well at the moment.\nHere are the pages where I will be documenting this stuff:\n\nLeg 1\nLeg 2, 3, 4\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "The primary study material I use is the textbook and I use the lectures to supplement it.\n\nI love the textbook. I got hooked with its style. The authors literally take you on a journey of deep learning and you don’t want to jump off the train in the middle. I can say it is one of my favourite textbooks.\nThe lectures provide fresh new percpectives on the things mentioned in the textbook. This helps learn better.\nSyntopically consuming both the textbook and the lectures is the best way to get the most out of it.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Unlike most of the MOOCs, the PDLC course is not something that you just finish off in 8 weeks and get done with it!\nI found myself going back in loops multiple times. Someimes when I am in lesson 5, I go back to lesson 1, then lesson 4, then I read chapter 4, and so on! I have embraced this. Initially, it was pretty darn confusing. I heard Jeremy say this, that often students go back in multiple loops with the course. I said to myself, maybe if I finish a lesson nicely then I would not feel the need of coming back. It is not like that. That is not how it works. Revisiting chapter 1 when you are in Week 5 feels like you have found a new treasure. You ask yourself, “How the hell did I miss this?!” Maybe you didn’t. It is only after you have gone till Week 5, you have got this new stream of thoughts that gives you insights.\nAll I know is staying with the course, engaging with it every single day, treating it like a journey, and not giving up will help me finish it succesfully one day.\n\n\n\n Back to top"
