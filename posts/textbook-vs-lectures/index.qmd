> The primary study material I use is the textbook and I use the lectures to supplement it.

I love the textbook. I got hooked with its style. The authors literally take you on a journey of deep learning and you don't want to jump off the train in the middle. I can say it is one of my favourite textbooks.

The lectures provide fresh new percpectives on the things mentioned in the textbook. This helps learn better. 

Syntopically consuming both the textbook and the lectures is the best way to get the most out of it.
