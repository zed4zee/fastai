In order to be a great deep learning practitioner, it was adviced by Jeremy and putforward by Radek to master this idea of the "4-legged" table. 

I need to work on these things in a structured way. I have been Googling stuff around to find various things. Apart from doing the PDLC course, I will be spending some time daily working on these things. My coding skills aren't sharp as well at the moment.

Here are the pages where I will be documenting this stuff:

- [Leg 1](https://zed4zee.github.io/python/) 
- [Leg 2, 3, 4](https://zed4zee.github.io/sc)
